Bank-Vista 6-Month Financial Trend: What the Numbers Reveal

Just finished reviewing a 6-month performance dashboard for Bank-Vista, using Power BI and the trends are telling 

📈 Profit is growing steadily, reaching $7.5M in June—the highest in the period. Total net profit now stands at $35.7M.
📊 ROA and ROE are climbing, showing improved operational efficiency and value to shareholders.
💵 Net Interest Margin (21.20%) is strong, rising month-over-month and aligning tightly with profit growth—healthy lending returns.

But not all smooth:

⚠️ May showed signs of liquidity pressure—deposits dropped below liabilities, and assets dipped. A potential early flag for treasury teams.
💡 June brought recovery across deposits, margins, and profits—suggesting agile response and financial discipline.

✅ Recommendations:

Strengthen monitoring around liability-deposit gaps.

Expand high-yield loan products driving NIM.

Reinvest surplus profits into scalable digital services.

Data shows the what. Good analysis tells us the why—and what’s next.
